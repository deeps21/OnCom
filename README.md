# On Community Portal
Online Community Platform

The main purpose behind creating this community portal application is to bring together people with common interests. User can read different posts and comments they can discover new things and if one likes them and has some insights to share they can comment on that specific community group and start building some knowledge repositories,in the real world we cannot really find people who share same interests as us, it is not necessarily be possible that the people beside you do share the same interests but here you are connected with the whole world so you  definitely can find a person who shares same interest as you.
